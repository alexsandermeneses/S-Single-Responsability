#S - Single Responsability. 

This project does not have code, as the intuition is to show that a class has to be specialized in a single subject and have only one responsibility within the software.

Violation of the Single Responsibility Principle can generate some problems, such as:
- Lack of cohesion
- High coupling
- Difficulties in implementing automated tests
- Difficulty in reusing codes
